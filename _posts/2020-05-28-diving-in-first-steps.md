It's been a few years since I've worked as a full-time programmer. In my current world of health informatics I still get do some work with scripting, querying databases and doing data analysis.. but this work is only a small portion of work that also includes writing briefing notes and working with clinicians to design more uability healthcare systems. Don't get me wrong -- I love these aspects of my work as well -- but I do miss sitting down, putting on my headphones, and working on a real-world problem for hours at a time.

So, I've decided it's time to get back into programming, upgrade my skillset, and see what opportunities may be out there. Artificial intelligence seems like the best way to go. The number of opportunities both in my field and out are enormous, and I have a group of friends who are doing the same thing. 

My first steps are to familarize myself with the field, the frameworks, and the theory. To accomplish that, I've recently completed the [Coursera Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) and followed along with the [PyTorch tutorial by sentdex on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdeMyHEYc0gxFpYwHY2Qfdh). By the way, you can find my implementation of that tutorial [on my github](https://github.com/tomsitter/ConvNN_CatsVsDogs_project).

For those of you also looking to learn AI, I highly recommend Andrew Ng's course to get a lot of exposure to the theory and architechure of neural networks. I also listen perioidically to several podcasts to familiarize myself with the field.
 * [Practical AI](https://changelog.com/practicalai) to keep up-to-date with latest developments
 * [Artificial Intelligence podcast](https://lexfridman.com/ai/) to hear the perspective of expert researchers

## Next Steps

During the Deep Learning course, my favourite project was Neural Style Transfer, which lets you apply a style from one image onto the contents of another. The best person I've found doing this on the internet is [ostagram.me](https://www.ostagram.me/). I'll be completing this in PyTorch first, then decide whether to re-implement in TensorFlow so I can compare approaches. Until then, keep checking back!
